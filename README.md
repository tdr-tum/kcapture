Additional Matlab files for the accompanying research paper.

These are some (!) of the files used to create my research paper. I leave them here in the hopes that the next person to work on this topic finds them useful. Please understand that these files are neither optimised, nor are they beautifully written. They were written to perform a scientific task, and they do that. Please also understand that these programs exist inside a huge mess of other small programs and data structures that have accumulated over the years (as they do), and therefore will probably not work on their own. Just use them as inspiration.  
If you want to use these files, please refer to my publication in your text.
